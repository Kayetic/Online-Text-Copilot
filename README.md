## Typing copilot

Imagine github copilot but for normal text. This is a simple implementation of a typing copilot. It uses the gpt-3.5-turbo-0125 and Mixtral 8x7B models from openai to generate text based on the input. The input is a few words and the model generates the next few words, which you can accept with the TAB key.
